## Python Examples ##

Here are some ready to go python apps that can be used to create a new project job on alpha.uvmcomputes.org.

**The requirements for running a Python application on #UVMComputes are:**

1. It must be contained in a single file (currently).
2. The application must be self executing.
3. Running the program must return a single variable as output. 

### hello_world.py ###

Jobs that run on the #UVMComputes can be simple procedural applications if they do what you need them to do.

This classic starter app returns the string, "Hello world!". 

Spice things up a little bit by changing the message to your own text before upload. Just be careful that you do not remove the "double quotes" or the job will fail with an error.

### random_planet.py ###

Programs can also classes to structure your code.

Random Planet generates a random number and uses it to generate a few fun facts about a planet in our solar system. 

Output for this application will be different based on the randomly generated number.

### random_numbers.py ###

Random Numbers generates a block of, you guessed it, random numbers. 

While not particularly useful for scientific computation, it does simulate a bit of work done by the supercomputer to generate output. 

### AFPO.py ###

AFPO uses multiple classes to encapsulate different functionality within in the single file. 
 
 This example was created by former MECLab member Shawn Beaulieu.
