The worlds first in-browser elastic supercomputer.

## What is #UVMComputes? ##

#UVMComputes is a website that allows visitors to share a small amount of their devices processing power with scientist who need to process research. By bringing together the processing power of many devices we work together as an in-browser supercomputer. The longer visitors stay on the page the more powerful our supercomputer becomes.

### Is my privacy at risk? ###
