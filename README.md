The worlds first in-browser elastic supercomputer.

## What is UVMComputes? ##

UVMComputes is a website that allows visitors to share a small amount of their devices processing power with scientist who need to process research. By bringing together the processing power of many devices we work together as an in-browser supercomputer. The longer visitors stay on the page the more powerful our supercomputer becomes.
### Is my privacy at risk? ###

Contribution to the supercomputer is anonymous; no data will be stored about individual machines. Additional no data will be stored on the users device.

### How can I participate? ###
You’ll have to be patient: work on this project just began in June of 2018; the project itself won’t be launched and advertised in June of 2020.
